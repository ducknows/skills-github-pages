Back in the day, when I was just a little tyke, I had this buddy who was all about online gaming. We'd dive into classics like Ragnarok, Tibia, and The Crimes. It was a time when Facebook hadn't even sprouted its social media wings. We were all about MSN, Orkut, ICQ, and Messenger for our chats.

My first interactions with computers were all about being a user. I'd lose myself in games like Carmen Sandiego and Drop Down Ski Mountain, loading them up from floppy disks. I hadn't gotten my hands on a console yet, so I'd hit up my friends' places for some console gaming.

One of my pals was totally hooked on Mu Online, but I never quite got the hang of that PvP stuff. I was more into leveling up my character and wasn't all that keen on the constant resets and item upgrades.

And then there was Gunbound. It was like the cool, updated version of Worms. The design was slick and simple, and the soundtrack? Man, it was so upbeat and awesome. That game really hit the spot.
